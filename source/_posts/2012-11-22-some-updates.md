While this website has been lying dormant, I have been doing many things that are more actively tracked on [twitter](http://twitter.com/divya). Here are some of the highlights of what I have been up to.

## Adobe
Some of you know I now work at Adobe. But I have since June been the Product Manager for the Web Engine team! I had not previously lived a life of a Product Manager, but for every programmer out there who thinks it is a better life, think again! I find it easier to program than to convince humans.

## Fripfrap
So [Garann](http://twitter.com/garannm) and I have a regular podcast/video stream going on. We didn't speak about it much because we were not sure if we really wanted to do it. But, after recording 3 episodes, I think it is worth your while to spend 20 minutes of your life on :) [Check it out](http://fripfrap.io)!

## Book
I have also been up to my gills writing a book on HTML5 Boilerplate. The toughest part of writing a technical book is how often code changes. [Nicolas Gallagher](http://twitter.com/necolas) has been doing such an excellent job of maintaining [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) that it was many times I had to rewrite a lot of chapters based on newer updates. Nevertheless, I **still** need to write more errata as there are already updates while the book went out to print!

You can [purchase the book at Packt](http://www.packtpub.com/html5-boilerplate-web-development/book) or get a [Kindle version on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Boilerplate-Web-Development-ebook/dp/B009RR0IFE). If you have already got your copy, please let me know if you have any feedback!

The money I earn on this book goes to [Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF) which consistantly is lauded for its effective aid programmes.

## Talks
I have been giving several talks over the few months in Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, UK and in US. I thought I would round up the major topic areas and link to videos of the talks as they exist:

### Designing in the browser

I posit that modern web technologies require designers to use the medium to design for it. [Slides for Designing in the Browser](http://nimbu.in/codemelb)

### Pushing the cutting edge forward
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/49730056?badge=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

A talk on what standards are, how they are created and how to effectively contribute to shaping how standards evolve without losing your mind. I gave the same talk @ SF HTML5 Meetup, which has the more up to date content. [Slides for Pushing the Cutting Edge Forward](http://nimbu.in/sfhtml5/)

### Web Components with your favourite CSS Specs
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FO3hTypPB1U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A talk on how to use the Shadow DOM with some new exciting CSS Specifications along with some important things to note while using these specs in tandem. [Slides for Web Components with your favourite CSS Specs](http://nimbu.in/jsconfeu/)

I will be giving a talk on what's next for CSS at [jscamp.asia](http://jscamp.asia). There is a good mix of interesting people coming by, so if you are in that region, please do come to the conference!

## Dotfiles
I finally found the time to customize my dotfiles! I started with [Mathias Bynens's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) as was recommended on [Github](http://dotfiles.github.com) and then went over to the others. But finally ended up on [Nicolas Gallagher's dotfiles](http://github.com/necolas/dotfiles) as they were most well-organized & written. I added an AWS CLI as I upload my screen captures to AWS S3 bucket and some other tiny aliases that I thought was useful.

I hope to spend my vacation writing my own website generator as one is bound to do and get rid of Octopress monolith! I hope you have a great holiday season!
